# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze **customer churn patterns** and identify key factors that drive customer retention or loss.  
By understanding these patterns, businesses can develop effective strategies to **reduce churn, improve customer loyalty, and increase profitability**.

## 🔍 Approach & Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Replaced missing or blank values in `TotalCharges`.
   - Converted data types for consistency.
   - Removed duplicate records.
   - Recoded binary fields (e.g., `SeniorCitizen`) into readable categories.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution analysis of customer demographics and services.
   - Visualization of churn vs. gender, senior citizen status, contract type, payment method, etc.
   - Correlation analysis between numerical variables (tenure, monthly charges, total charges).

3. **Visualization**
   - Count plots and pie charts to show churn proportions.
   - Stacked bar charts to compare churn across demographics and services.
   - Heatmaps to show correlation strength.

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Overall Churn Rate**  
  ~**26.5% of customers have churned**.

- **Demographics**
  - Gender has little impact on churn.
  - **Senior citizens churn more often** compared to younger customers.

- **Customer Tenure**
  - **New customers (<12 months)** churn significantly more.
  - **Long-tenure customers** are more stable and loyal.

- **Contract Type**
  - **Month-to-month contracts** have the **highest churn**.
  - **Two-year contracts** have the **lowest churn** → long-term contracts improve retention.

- **Payment Method**
  - Customers paying via **electronic check have the highest churn**.
  - Auto-payments (credit card/bank transfer) show lower churn rates.

- **Monthly Charges**
  - **High monthly charges** correlate with higher churn → customers may be price-sensitive.

- **Services**
  - Lack of **value-added services** (online security, tech support) increases churn likelihood.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- **Retention Programs for New Customers**: Strengthen onboarding in the first year.
- **Encourage Long-Term Contracts**: Offer discounts or loyalty rewards for 1–2 year plans.
- **Senior Citizen Support**: Provide targeted offers and dedicated customer service.
- **Reduce Payment Friction**: Promote auto-payments to reduce churn from electronic check users.
- **Address Price Sensitivity**: Introduce bundled or flexible plans for high-charge customers.

- Reduce churn rate by retaining vulnerable customer segments.
- Increase **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** through longer retention.
- Boost overall profitability while enhancing customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.
